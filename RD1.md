* Working with my partner was Alright since we separated all the work while he did the encryption and flow chart, I did the algorithm and wrote out the code. During this lab, it was confusing in some cases which I wasn't able to fix throughout the code. I was trying to make to user input a string and then if the user entered a string it would go into a while loop and repeat to tell the user to input a valid value until the user inputs a valid input. I tried to use the "isdigit" in my while loop but it didn't give me the answer I wanted which led to me wasting a lot of time on the code which caused a lot of changes in my code and made it simpler for it to run. After that, I tested my inputs and all of them went through unless if there was an invalid input which made you restart the program.
