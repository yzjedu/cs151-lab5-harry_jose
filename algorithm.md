#### PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! THINK before you code...
# 1) Set Balance value to 1000
# 2) Prompt user to input D, W, V, or E
# 3) while user does not enter D, W, V, or E
#       A) prompt user to input a valid input between D, W, V, or E
# 4) set user input to lowercase
# 5) If user inputs equals "e"
#       A) End program
# 6) while user input equals "d"
#       A) Prompt user to input a positive number on how much they want to deposit
#       B) while user input is less than 0 
#           a) Prompt user to input a positive number 
#       C) Add user input to balance 
#       D) Prompt user to input D, W, V, or E
#       E) while user does not enter D, W, V, or E
#           a) prompt user to input a valid input between D, W, V, or E
#       F) set user input to lowercase
# 7) while user input equals "w" 
#       A) Prompt user input a negative number they want to withdraw
#       B) while user input is greater than 0 
#           a) Prompt user input a negative number or enter 0 to return to other actions
#       C) Add user input to balance 
#       D) If the user balance is less than 0
#           a) prompt user to input yes or no if they want to continue the action knowing they will have a negative balance and a 5% interest rate would be charged on the balance
#           b) while user does not input "yes" or "no"
#               i) prompt user to input a valid input between yes or no
#           c) If the user enters "yes" 
#               i) user balance is multiplied by 1.05
#           d) else 
#               i) make user input into absolute value and add to balance
#       D) Prompt user to input D, W, V, or E
#       E) while user does not enter D, W, V, or E
#           a) prompt user to input a valid input between D, W, V, or E
#       F) set user input to lowercase
# 8) while user input equals "v"
#       A) output user balance 
#       B) Prompt user to input D, W, V, or E
#       C) while user does not enter D, W, V, or E
#           a) prompt user to input a valid input between D, W, V, or E
#       D) set user input to lowercase
